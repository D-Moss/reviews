				<h2>Checkers</h2>
				<p>
					Stopped by Checkers for a quick bite and left already planning my next visit. The fries were everything you want—crispy, hot, and seasoned just right. Pairing them with a chocolate milkshake was a genius move. The shake was thick enough to feel indulgent but still smooth and sippable. That contrast of salty heat and cool sweetness? Chef’s kiss. It’s the kind of flavor combo that makes you pause mid-bite just to appreciate it. No frills, just really satisfying comfort food done right.

				<h2>EVO Brick Oven Pizza</h2>
				<p>
					First time trying EVO Brick Oven Pizza and I was genuinely impressed. The crust was brushed with garlic butter (a delicious touch), and the cheese was hot, flavorful, and perfectly melty. You can really taste the quality in every bite.
				</p>
				<p>
					The staff were super friendly and the service was smooth from start to finish. I also loved the cozy vibe—there were cute plants tucked around the space, plus dog treats and lollipops by the counter, which felt like such a sweet, welcoming gesture.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prices are a bit higher than my usual pizza spots, but honestly, the flavor and freshness made it worth it. Great pizza overall—I’d definitely eat here again.
