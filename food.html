				<h2>Checkers</h2>
				<p>
					Stopped by Checkers for a quick bite and left already planning my next visit. The fries were everything you want—crispy, hot, and seasoned just right. Pairing them with a chocolate milkshake was a genius move. The shake was thick enough to feel indulgent but still smooth and sippable. That contrast of salty heat and cool sweetness? Chef’s kiss. It’s the kind of flavor combo that makes you pause mid-bite just to appreciate it. No frills, just really satisfying comfort food done right.

				<h2>EVO Brick Oven Pizza</h2>
				<p>
					First time trying EVO Brick Oven Pizza and I was genuinely impressed. The crust was brushed with garlic butter (a delicious touch), and the cheese was hot, flavorful, and perfectly melty. You can really taste the quality in every bite.
				</p>
				<p>
					The staff were super friendly and the service was smooth from start to finish. I also loved the cozy vibe—there were cute plants tucked around the space, plus dog treats and lollipops by the counter, which felt like such a sweet, welcoming gesture.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prices are a bit higher than my usual pizza spots, but honestly, the flavor and freshness made it worth it. Great pizza overall—I’d definitely eat here again.

				<h2>IHOP</h2>
				<p>
					We tried to give IHOP a fair shot—twice. First visit, the place looked so lifeless we weren’t even sure it was open. Dim lights, no visible staff, and a vibe that said “closed” more than “welcome.” We left, hoping it was just a fluke.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next day, my parents visited a different location, craving the classic IHOP pancake experience. What they got was anything but. The pancakes—IHOP’s supposed crown jewel—were a letdown from the first glance. Stuck together like they’d been steamed, not griddled. When they pulled them apart, the middles were pale and doughy, almost raw. They noticed other tables had abandoned their pancakes too, which should’ve been a red flag.
				</p>
				<p>
					Still, they gave it a try. Butter and syrup couldn’t save them. The texture was mushy, like undercooked batter soaked in syrup. No fluff, no golden crisp edges—just a soggy mess. The eggs and bacon were passable, but when the main attraction is this disappointing, it’s hard to enjoy the sides.
				</p>
				<p>
					To top it off, there was no manager on duty to address the issue, so the pancakes stayed on the bill. No apology, no resolution. Just a quiet exit and a shared decision: no more IHOP.
