				<h2>Staybridge Suites</h2>
				<h5>Family Vacation, 8/10/25-8/12/25</h5>
				<div class="image">

				</div>
				<p>
					I booked Staybridge Suites for a short family vacation with my parents, niece, and nephew. We had 2 rooms, both were a One-Bedroom King Suite.The property made a strong first impression—clean, madern, and well lit. Even the outside lighting added to the overall appearance and created a sense of safety when arriving or walking in at night.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check-in was easy, and the suite was very clean with nothing out of place. The bed was really comfortable, and the hotel stayed quiet throughout the stay, which made it easy to rest. The bathroom was clean as well, with adequate water pressure. I didn't interact with the staff much, but the few encounters I had were pleasant—everyone was friendly and nice. I felt safe at the property and found the price fair, especially with the small discount I received. The hotel offers several helpful amenities, including free breakfast, an indoor pool, a small gym, and plenty of outlets in the room, making the suite especially convenient for families or anyone who needs space to unwind.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would definitely stay here again. Staybridge Suites is a strong fit for quick stays, families, and even solo travelers depending on what they're looking for. The price I paid was worth the stay, and while most stores require a short drive, the comfort, cleanliness, and amenities make this a great choice for a relaxed Poconos visit.

				<h2>The STRAT</h2>
				<h5>Late Birthday Getaway, 5/10/25-5/15/25</h5>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/W4GTmFLz/strat.jpg" alt="image 1">
				</div>
				<p>
					I booked The STRAT for a late birthday getaway and stayed in a Boulevard Suite. My first impression was positive—the lobby was nice, and the property felt lively without being overwhelming. Nothing stood out immediately as a concern, and the suite looked clean and inviting on arrival.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check-in was very easy, although I did arrive a bit early and had to wait until the room was ready. Once inside, the suite was clean and everything was in place. The bed was comfortable, not too hard. Noise levels were surprisingly manageable; I didn't hear anything from other rooms, just the occasional hallway sounds common in Vegas hotels. The bathroom was clean, and both the water temperature and water pressure were perfect. Staff I interacted with were friendly and helpful, and I felt safe throughout the stay—though it's worth noting that some areas off the Strip can feel less polished. For the price, especially for Vegas, the suite offered good value and a comfortable base for the trip.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was my second stay at The STRAT, and I would stay again. It's a great fit for solo travelers and anyone looking for a comfortable room, good amenities, and easy access to food and entertainment. The hotel sits right outside the main Strip area, giving you a quick access to cafes, bars, and attractions without the dense crowds. The overall experience was solid, convenient, and worth the price for the location.

				<h2>Host Inn All Suites Hotel</h2>
				<h5>Christmas Vacation, 12/22/24-12/29/24</h5>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Dzk7bQD7/host.jpg" alt="image 2">
				</div>
				<p>
					I booked Host Inn All Suites for a Christmas vacation and stayed in a King Suite. The outside could use a makeover, but the lobby was decorated nicely for the holiday season, which helped created a warm first impression. Overall, the property felt familiar, as I've stayed here multiple times before.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check-in was smooth, and the room was mostly clean, though some dishes and cookware weren't provided. The bed was comfortable, and while noise levels were generally low, I could occasionally hear people running around and the sound of nearby dogs barking. The bathroom was clean, and the water pressure was good. Staff at this property are consistently friendly and helpful, and I felt safe throughout the stay. For a holiday week, the price was good and felt fair for the value offered.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've stayed at Host Inn multiple times and would stay again. It's a good fit for quick stays and families who need space and a basic, comfortable setup. There are plently of stores and food options in the area, and its location near major roads makes it easy to get around. As long as you're comfortable with an older property that could use a cosmetic updates, the stay is reliable.

				<h2>Residence Inn</h2>
				<h5>Labor Day Vacation, 9/2/24-9/5/24</h5>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/SKFmzLPr/residence.jpg" alt="Residence Inn">
				</div>
				<p>
					I booked the Residence Inn for an end-of-summer trip and stayed in a One-Bedroom King Suite with a sofa bed. The outside and lobby looked nice on arrival and gave a clean, welcoming first impression. Nothing stood out as unusual or concering right away, which set a positive tone for the stay.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check-in was easy, and the entire suite—including the room and kitchen—was clean and fresh. The bed was really comfortable, and the hotel itself stayed quiet throughout the stay, which made it easy to rest. The bathroom was clean and well stocked with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, which was a nice touch. Staff interactions were pleasant and helpful, and I felt safe at the property. For the price, this hotel delivered exactly what I expected and felt like a good value overall.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm not sure I'd stay here again only because there wasn't much I personally wanted to do in the immediate area, but the property itself is solid. It's a good fit for quick stays, road trips, and families looking for a clean, quiet place to land. The Baltimore Harbor is a short drive away, but the surrounding area doesn't offer much to explore on foot.
